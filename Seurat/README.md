MainAnalysis: S. Schneider's main analysis scripts for pre-processing (filtering) scRNA data and generating the initial differential expression results.

DifferentialExpression: K. Beigel's replication of S. Schneider's differential expresison analysis, using updated cluster names. The purpose of this was to make sure the resulting files were standardized and that S. Schenider's process was reproducible.
