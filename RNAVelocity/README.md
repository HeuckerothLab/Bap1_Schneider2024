# RNA Velocity analysis
RNA velocity analysis was performed using velocyto and scVelo, following the steps outlined in K. Beigel's [rna_velocity_basic](https://github.com/beigelk/rna_velocity_basic) repository. WT and KO conditions were analyzed separately. The input files for this analysis are available on the [osf.io](osf.io) page for this project.
